# MachineLearningAlgorithms
These are 6 machine learning algorithms that I implemented from scratch using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. 

These algorithms include the Perceptron, MultiLayer Perceptron (Nueral Network), Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighter, K Means Cluster, and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm.

After implementing my custom approach to each algorithm on various datasets (mostly from the public UCI Machine Learning Repository), I use scikit-learn's machine learning algorithm's to test the difference in accuracy and speed between both.
