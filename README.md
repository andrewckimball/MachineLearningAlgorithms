# Machine Learning Algorithms
These are 6 machine learning algorithms that I implemented from scratch using Python in Jupyter Notebooks as part of my coursework for Computer Science 472 at BYU.

These algorithms include the Perceptron, MultiLayer Perceptron (Nueral Network), Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, K Means Clustering, and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithms.

After implementing my custom approach to each algorithm on various datasets (mostly from the public UCI Machine Learning Repository), I use scikit-learn's machine learning algorithm's to test the difference in accuracy and speed between both.
